# Salt-master script for creating repos for Ubuntu and CentOS (or just one of them)

This script allows you to create a local repo directory from the master-salt machine
    - This has stripped hours of my life so please enjoy

## Few important points
- This script assumes that you have mounted the correct repo location already
- Docker mode (under Ubuntu) will wipe your sources.list
- Other things are assumed, but you have to see for yourself
