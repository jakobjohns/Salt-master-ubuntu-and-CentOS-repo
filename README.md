# Salt-master script for creating repos for Ubuntu and CentOS (or just one of them)

This script allows you to create a local repo directory from the master-salt machine
    - This has stripped hours of my life so please enjoy

## Modules that may be needed
This program uses a python module called "progress"
- It can be installed using the command below
- First install python3-pip
`apt install python3-pip`
- Last install progress
`pip3 install progress`

**I don't think a restart is needed, but if an error is thrown possibly**
